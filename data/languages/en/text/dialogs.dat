Hi! Welcome to this dungeon. I'd love
to hear your thoughts about it, it's still
slightly under construction with some areas being a bit plain but overall it should be impossible to get stuck and reaching the boss room should be an interesting experience with many possible ways to get there.

I want to have switches that do something interesting here
but it's tricky. So for now there's just two chests here.
Sorry.
